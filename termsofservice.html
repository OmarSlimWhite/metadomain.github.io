Article 2. Applicability<br><br>

2.2 The Terms are also applicable to contracts with the Contractor, for which Third Parties are involved by the Contractor to carry out the contract. <br>

2.6 The Contractor is at all times entitled to unilaterally amend these Terms. Any such changes will take effect on the date such amendments are communicated to the Client, or upon Client’s first use of the Website and/or the Services, whichever occurs earlier. <br><br>
Article 3. Contractor and its Services
3.1 Contractor is located at 245 North Highland Avenue, Suite 230-235, Atlanta, Georgia 30307. Contractor is responsible for exploiting the Website. Please refer to Contractor should you have any questions or queries with respect to the Website. <br>
However, in order to warrant the availability of the funds transferred and/or payments made and/or payments made with respect to any transaction executed through the Website, DomainMetaverse.io, located at 245 North Highland Avenue, Suite 230-235, Atlanta, Georgia 30307, shall be considered the Contractor for these services. In order to service US based clients who transfer funds and/or payments with the use of a credit or debit card, DomainMetaverse.io, located at 245 North Highland Avenue, Suite 230-235, Atlanta, Georgia 30307, USA shall be considered the Contractor with respect to these transactions. <br>
3.2 The Contractor operates the Website. The Website offers a platform on which a User can: <br>
1.	offer domain names for sale,
<br>2.	search for, view, purchase, lease or rent available domain names;
<br>3.	acquire Contracting Services from the Contractor (including customer support services pre and post transaction);
<br>4.	acquire Registrar Services from the Contractor (see B: Registrar Services); and
<br>5.	in the case of API Transactional Services, permit Third Parties to access API Transactional Services (see C: API Transactional Services). <br><br>
3.3 In performing the Services as referred to above under (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5), the Contractor facilitates the handling and executing of an agreement to transfer a domain name (either through ownership transfer or transfer of associated rights, such as lease or rental) between the Provider, the Transferee and/or Third Parties. The Contractor enables the communication between these parties and facilitates the transfer of the domain name after payment or the availability to the DNS of a domain name in case of a Lease to Own Agreement or Rental Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, except for its role as a depositing party (i.e., the entity holding title to the domain name) under the Lease to Own Agreement or Rental Agreement, Contractor is not a party to any such agreement among the Provider, the Transferee and/or third Parties, and Contractor assumes no liability and bears no responsibility in respect of any such agreement. <br>
3.4 Parties acknowledge and agree that the Contractor cannot exercise any rights to and therefore has no influence on the actual state of the domain name, including the accessibility of the domain name offered by the Provider. Contractor does not make any guarantees or warranties with respect to the domain name. In case of a dispute with respect to the domain name, Provider and the Transferee shall resolve such dispute between themselves. Contractor may provide facilitating services, at its sole discretion, in order to help Provider and Transferee resolve their dispute amicably. <br>
3.5 Provider and Transferee will enter into a separate agreement when either the Provider or Transferee has accepted the last offer made by the Transferee or Provider on the domain name of the Provider. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a binding agreement will be deemed to have been entered into between Transferee and the Provider if the Transferee initiates a purchase via the so called “buy now” or “lease to own” options. <br>
3.6 In exchange for the Services, Contractor is entitled to a commission fee from Provider, payable upon execution of the respective agreement between the Provider and Transferee. Contractor shall transfer the associated payment with a deduction of the applicable commission fee from the Domain Name Price. <br>
3.7 If the Provider and the Transferee have agreed on a Domain Name Price in a Lease to Own Agreement or Rental Agreement, the Parties shall enter into a Lease to Own Agreement or Rental Agreement, which shall be sent to the Transferee. The Provider will deliver the domain name under retention of title to Contractor, and Contractor shall hold the domain name until the Transferee has paid the full agreed Domain Name Price in accordance with the Lease to Own Agreement. While the Lease to Own Agreement is in effect, the Contractor maintains the domain name on behalf of the Provider and Transferee. Contractor does not, however, accept any liability, nor does it provide any warranty or guarantee other than that it will hold the title in the domain name for the duration of the Lease to Own Agreement. The Transferee may use the domain name under the conditions as set out in the Lease to Own Agreement until the transfer has taken place. <br>
3.8 The Contractor shall at all times retain the right to cancel and/or terminate any Lease to Own Agreement and/or payment of the Domain Name Price if the Contractor believes this to be reasonably necessary (in its sole discretion), without any right of restitution of instalment(s) already paid and/or payment of any damages (whether direct or indirect). For the avoidance of doubt, if a Lease to Own Agreement is cancelled and/or terminated for whatever reason, the Lease to Own Agreement will retroactively be considered to have been a Rental Agreement, and all instalments paid are to be considered as rent, and Transferee shall not be entitled to restitution of any installment payments. <br>
3.9 When the applicable contractual and other requirements described herein are met, the Contractor will complete the transaction of the domain name transfer and/or Domain Name Price in accordance with its own procedures. Parties acknowledge and agree that the Contractor is not a payment provider and that Contractor does not make any warranties in that respect. In order to effectuate the transfer of payments, Contractor uses the services of a third-party payment provider. The terms and conditions of the third-party payment provider shall apply to such payments. <br>
3.10 The Contractor shall at all times be entitled to transfer or assign its rights and obligations under the agreements relating to the Services to one of its group companies or its other appointed third parties and to amend its Services unilaterally. The Client can only transfer or assign its rights and obligations from the agreement(s) upon prior written consent from the Contractor. <br>
3.11 Provider/Rentor hereby appoints Contractor as its agent for the limited purpose of receiving payments from Transferees/Rentees. The Provider/Rentor agrees that the full payment of the Domain Name Price to Contractor, or monthly instalment or rental payment (in the case of a Lease to Own Agreement or Rental Agreement), constitutes final payment to Provider/Rentor extinguishing the Transferee's/Rentee's payment obligation to the Provider/Rentor as if the Transferee/Rentee had paid the Provider/Rentor directly, even if payment is not received by Provider/Rentor from Contractor. Contractor, not the Transferee/Rentee, is solely liable to the Provider/Rentor if Contractor fails to remit payments received from Transferee/Rentee to the Provider/Rentor. <br>
3.12 In the case of a domain name purchase, Contractor shall retain the funds received in connection with a domain name purchase until successful transfer of the domain name to the Transferee. In connection with the Lease to Own Agreement or Rental Agreement, Contractor shall retain the first monthly instalment or rental payment until successful transfer of the domain name to Contractor. If you are a Transferee/Rentee, you acknowledge and agree that Contractor is not holding funds on your behalf. If you are a Provider/Rentor, you acknowledge and agree that you have requested that the settlement of funds to you be delayed as provided in this Clause<br>
3.13 Nothing in this Clause shall affect the fact that the Transferee's or Rentee's payment obligation for the domain name is fully satisfied upon receipt of funds by Contractor as set forth in Clause . <br><br>
Article 4. Rights and Obligations of the Client<br>
4.1 Client represents and warrants that it (i) has the full authority and all rights necessary to enter into and fully perform all if its obligations under these Terms; (ii) will not infringe the patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, right of publicity, or other intellectual property or proprietary right of any third party in its use of the Website or the Services; (iii) will comply with these Terms and all applicable laws, rules, and regulations in its use of the Website and Services; (iv) will not attempt to gain unauthorized access to another network or server; (v) will not disrupt, interfere with, damage, limit the function of, or suspend the use of, this Website or Services, including, without limitation, through the use, delivery or transmission of any viruses, harmful code, unsolicited emails, Trojan horses or any other computer programming routines that are intended to disrupt, damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept or expropriate any system, data or personal information; and (vi) will not perform any false, abusive or fraudulent activity. <br>
4.2 If an agreement is reached between the Provider and the Transferee with respect to a domain name, the Provider and the Transferee will undertake to provide full cooperation to the Contractor so that the Contractor can facilitate the transfer of the domain name. Upon verification of receipt of the applicable Domain Name Price, Contractor shall transfer the domain name to Transferee. If the Provider and the Transferee have agreed to a Lease to Own Agreement regarding the Domain Name Price, the domain name shall be transferred upon securing the total Domain Name Price in accordance with the conditions as set out in the applicable Lease to Own Agreement. <br>
4.3 Contractor shall invoice the Client upon providing the Services. Parties agree that separate payment and/or billing instructions may apply or be entered into by way of a separate agreement (including a Rental Agreement or Lease to Own Agreement). In case of a domain name transfer between two companies, the Transferee shall submit its business information (including address and VAT reference number, if applicable) to the Contractor in order for Contractor to generate the invoice. <br>
4.4 If the Contractor, for whatever reason, is unable to carry out its work or perform the Services, Contractor shall cancel the Services or, in its sole discretion, work in good faith with the Client(s) to reach a mutually agreed to solution for all Parties involved with respect to such Services. <br>
4.5 If the Client has not fulfilled its obligations under the respective agreement(s), Contractor shall not be obligated to proceed with the transfer of the domain name. In that event, Client will be considered to be in default (“verzuim”) with immediate effect, without the need to be provided with a notice of default or a term to remedy the breach. Without limiting any other rights or remedies that Contractor may have, the Contractor is entitled to cancel the transaction and/or terminate the respective agreement(s) with immediate effect, without being liable for any direct or indirect damages to the Client. <br>
4.6 The Client must provide the Contractor with correct and valid contact information, including Client’s email address. Client acknowledges and agrees that it is Client’s own responsibility to provide Contractor with valid contact information and a valid email address, and to update this information as often as may be reasonably necessary. Client cannot hold Contractor liable for any missed communication or any negative effects resulting from such missed communication, if such communication was sent to invalid or outdated contact details of the Client. <br>
4.7 Payment of any costs or charges should always be made in the manner and within the period as stated on the invoice and in the currency as provided in said invoice, unless explicitly specified otherwise by the Contractor. <br>
4.8 In case of a disputed invoice by the Client, Client shall inform the Contractor of its objections within 3 days after the date of invoice by means of a written appeal transmitted via email or electronic form. If the Client has not disputed the invoice as set forth in this Clause 4.8, the Client shall be deemed to have accepted the invoice entirely. Partial or full dispute of any invoice will not suspend the Client’s payment obligations thereof. Any failure to timely pay the invoice in full may result in additional surcharges in accordance with the statutory interest, apart from any other rights and remedies that the Contractor may have. In addition, Client is not entitled to set-off any amounts payable to the Contractor. <br>
4.9 If the Contractor cancels a transfer of a domain name through no fault of the Client, the Transferee will be refunded within 3 business days after cancellation (except in case of a Lease to Own Agreement as per Clause 3.8 and 7.12). If the domain name had already been transferred to the Contractor’s temporary domain holding account or registrar, the Provider will receive a new authorization code within 3 business days in order for the Provider to regain control and ownership over the domain name. If such provision of the authorization code is not possible for whatever reason, including a possible transfer lock, the Provider and Contractor will discuss and agree to an alternative way of returning control and ownership of the domain name to the Provider. <br>
4.10 Within 30 days after payment of the Domain Name Price to Contractor, the Transferee shall effectuate the transfer of the domain name itself in accordance with the transfer instructions as sent by the Contractor. Parties may agree to an extension of the transfer period, for example in case the transfer of the domain name is explicitly delayed as agreed by the Contractor and Transferee. If the Transferee doesn’t transfer the domain name within the set timeframe of 30 days, and no exceptions to this clause have explicitly been made, the Transferee is deemed to have waived its rights to the domain name. In the event the transfer of the domain name has not been effectuated within the 30 day’s timeframe, the Contractor will be the legal owner of the domain name. Parties acknowledge and agree that no refund of the Domain Name Price is possible after payment of the Domain Name Price to the Provider. <br>
4.11 When the Provider has already received the agreed Domain Name Price, the respective transaction cannot be reverted, canceled or refunded. In such event, the Provider can no longer make any ownership claims with respect to the domain name to Contractor. <br><br>

7.5 In case of violation of the Terms included in Clause 5 and this Clause 7, the Transferee shall forfeit (in addition to Contractor’s other rights and remedies) an immediately payable contractual penalty of twice the amount of the fees included in the Lease to Own Agreement, or, in case of a Rental Agreement, 24 times the monthly rent.

Rentor acknowledges and agrees that it shall be fully liable to the Contractor and/or the Rentee for any damages resulting from its breach of this clause. <br>
7.7 If the Transferee fails and/or neglects to fulfil its obligations as per the respective agreement, the Provider may terminate the agreement with immediate effect.
